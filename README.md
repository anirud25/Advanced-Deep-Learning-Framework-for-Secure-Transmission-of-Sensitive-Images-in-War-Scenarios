# Advanced Deep Learning Framework for Secure Transmission of Sensitive Images in War Scenarios

## Overview  
This project presents a deep learning-based framework for the **secure transmission of sensitive images** in scenarios related to **national security**, such as war and border protection. The framework ensures the **confidentiality** and **integrity** of transmitted images by using advanced encoding and decoding techniques. It employs **Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography** and state-of-the-art deep learning models such as **ResNet50**, **VGG16**, and **Inception_v3** for image encoding and decoding.

The framework is designed to safeguard sensitive image data, minimize data corruption, and ensure lossless decoding, making it a valuable tool for critical national security applications.

## Features  
- **Deep Learning-Based Encoding**: Securely encode sensitive images using advanced architectures (e.g., ResNet50, VGG16).  
- **LSB Steganography**: Used for decoding the encoded images with high accuracy.  
- **Data Integrity Validation**: Comparison between original and decoded images to ensure minimal loss or corruption during transmission.  
- **Secure Transmission Pipeline**: Focused on protecting data confidentiality and integrity in national security scenarios.  
- **Experimental Validation**: Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in secure image transmission.
